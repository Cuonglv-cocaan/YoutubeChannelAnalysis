> **CONTENT**


> **IDEAS**

The analysis context comes from the idea of how beauty topics are on the YouTube video platform. Definition of the content of which products are trending. Starting from that, I conducted a project to analyze some famous beauty bloggers in Vietnam.

>**SCRAPPING DATA**

`Step 1` Setup environment and API.

`Step 2` Get ChannelID of channels that I want to analyze.

In this Project I chose some famous beauty blogger like: `#Chang Makeup`

`Step 3` Scrapping and Preprocessing raw data.

`Step 4` Extract data to CSV file.

For more detail about the Python code I used to scrapping. Please contact me via: lvcuong2801@gmail.com
