> **CONTENT**


> **IDEAS**

The analysis context comes from the idea of how beauty topics are on the YouTube video platform. Definition of the content of which products are trending. Starting from that, I conducted a project to analyze some famous beauty bloggers in Vietnam.

>**SCRAPPING DATA**

`Step 1` Setup environment and API.

`Step 2` Get ChannelID of channels that I want to analyze.

In this Project I chose some famous beauty blogger like: `#Chang Makeup`, `#Chloe Nguyen`, `#Happy Skin VN`, `#Linh Truong`, `#Mai Van Trang`, `#Quynh Anh Shyn`, `#Trinh Pham`

`Step 3` Scrapping and Preprocessing raw data.

`Step 4` Extract data to CSV file.

For more detail about the Python code I used to scrapping. Please contact me via: lvcuong2801@gmail.com

>**LOAD CSV file to PowerBI**

You can see in the dataset that the data ranges from 11 April 2010 to 14 March 2023. Because it is a large time range, I created a slicer to filter for the dashboard.

I also create a slicer about Channel that you can filter when needed

Another Slicer is TOP N, the purpose is to filter TOP (5, 10, 15) some feature in the charts.

>> **`View per video`**

Firstly, let me tell you the current status of our beauty bloggers.
`Chang makeup` has produced some interesting videos. This helped them to achieve the highest average views per video.
Meanwhile, the rest also produced many million-view videos but they didn't get audience attention, the average video per video declined.

>>**Views per Minute**

`Quynh Anh Shyn`â€™s Views per Minute rank the second despite their video not having as many views as `Chang Makeup` or the others.
